## 1

**PROBLEM:** If r is rational ($r \neq 0$) and x is irrational, prove that r+x and rx are irrational.


**PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:** 

Let $r \in Q$ and $x \in R$

Assume $r + x \in Q$, then $ r - r + x \in Q$, but that is saying $x \in Q$. We get a contradiction because we started with knowing that $x \in R$.

Similarly, assume $rx \in Q$. We get that $ \frac{rx}{r} \in Q$, which is a contradiction.

**PROBLEM:** Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 12

**PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:** 

Since $\sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}$ it is enough to prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

Let m and n be integers having no common factors. We have $3 n^2 = m^2$.

This means $m^2$ is divisible by 3 which also means $m$ is divisible by 3. Let $m = 3k$ then we get

$$3n^2 = 9 k^2$$

$$n^2 = 3 k^2$$

It then follows that n is divisible by 3. That is a contradiction because we assumed that n and m don't have any common factors.

**PROBLEM:** Prove proposition 1.5.

**Proposition:** The axioms for multiplication imply the following statements

* a) if $x \neq 0$ and $xy = zx$ then $y = z$
* b) if $x \neq 0$ and $xy = x$ then $y = 1$
* c) if $x \neq 0$ and $xy = 1$ then $y = 1/x$
* d) if $x \neq 0$ then $1 / (1/x) = x$
