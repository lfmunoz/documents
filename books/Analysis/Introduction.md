# Analysis

Mathematical analysis deals with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions.

# Dedekind cuts

In mathematics often there is something that works.

It may not be understood why it works. Someone offers an explanation
but it isn't flawed, at least it is some explanation. 

People disagree that Dedekind cuts are valid
it doesn't matter because maybe there is some other formulation
which is more accurate or makes more sense, but that doesn't mean
what Dedekind cuts are trying to do isn't valid.





# Group


A field is any set where addition and multiplication are well-defined operations
that are 

* commutative
* associative
* obey distributive property a(b + c) = ab + ac.
* additive identity, 
* every element must have an additive inverse.
* there must be a multiplicative identity
* multiplicative inverses must exist for all nonzero elements of the field.


Neither Z nor N is a field.
