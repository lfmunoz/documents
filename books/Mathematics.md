# Mathematics 


Most professional mathematicians believe we are like in Plato's cave, and there is an idealized world which we only have glimpses of. We get ideas of the ideal objects.

This **mathematical object** is an idea that you can describe very precisely. Described in a way that rules out any contradictions. Within this framework we try to discover truths. 

Let us be honest, the foundation of mathematics has gaps. It is trying to do the impossible, define precisely what an object is. What exactly is existence and truth? How do we start?

The foundations of mathematics works backwards. We have theories we want to get to (i.e, the Fundamental Theory of Calculus), so we ask what are the minimum number of assumptions we need to have to get to those theorems? We come up axioms and see if we can further break them down. 

The idea of a Collection or Set are the most primitive ideas which we know lead to all the rest of mathematics.
