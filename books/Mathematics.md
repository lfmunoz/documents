What is mathematics?



Explore the world of ideas or mathematical concepts. We are like in Plato's cave, and there is an idealized world which we only have glimpses of. We get ideas of the ideal objects.

A mathematical object is an idea that you have described very precisely. Described in a way that rules out any contradictions.

Within this framework we try to discover truths. 

Mathematics is disconnected from reality, but not completely. Mathematical objects are objects of thought, but we can model reality with mathematics.




For sets D and F, we use the notation $F^D$ to denote all functions from D to F.
set of functions from the set W of words to the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers is denoted $\mathbb{R}^W$
