R, Q, P - formulae, Schematic Letters, propositions

Standing in for sentences which are or express propositions.

Interpret a setence letter just by assigning to it a truth-value (T or F)


$\vDash$  entails (sign is pronounced turnstile)

$\Gamma \vDash \phi$

There is no interpretation in which every formula $\gamma$ is true and the formula 
$\phi$ is false.


Any sentence that exemplifies schema $$ \gamma \entails \phi $$
with actual formulae will be called a sequent

**Modus Ponens**
if P then Q; P; therefore Q 

An **argument-schema** counts as a valid schema if there is no interpretation in wich
each of the premise-formulae comes out true and the conclusion-formula comes out false


$\phi$ is any formula

$\gamma$ is any set of formula


$$\entails \phi$$  claim that $\phi$ is valid
There is no interpretation in which $\phi$ is false

$$\gamma \entails$$ there is no interpretation in which every formulate in $\gamma$ is true
can be read as "is inconsistent"

There is a proof whose conclusion is $\phi$ and whose undischarged assumptions
are all in the set $\gamma$

When is true the sequent is correct

$\gamma$ can be empty $\entails \phi$ this sequence is correct iff there is a proof of $\phi$ with no
discharged assumptions


A **sequent** makes a definite claim that certain formulae are related in a particular way and it is either true or false


$\phi$ is a statement the conclusion of the sequent and $\gamma$ is a set of statements the assumptions of the sequent
