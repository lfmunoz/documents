A great epoch in the history of logic did open in 1879, when Gottlob Frege's
Begri.ffsschrift was published. This book freed logic from an artificial connection with
mathematics but at the same time prepared a deeper interrelation between these two
sciences. It presented to the world, in full-fledged form, the propositional calculus
and quantification theory.
