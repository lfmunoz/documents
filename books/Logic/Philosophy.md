# Mathematical Philosophy


**Platonist** - mathematical objects have an existence independent of humnan thought, and thus the job of mathematicians is to discover the truths about these mathematical objects

**Intuitionist** - (L. E. J. Brouwer) Mathematics should be restricted to concrete operations performed on finite structures

**Formalist** - (Hilbert) Mathematics is nothing more than the manipulation of meaningless symbols according to certain rules and that the consistency of such a system was nothing more than saying that the rules prohibited certain combinations of the symbols from occuring.



### Realist

Committed to the notion that words mathematicians use already have a meaning independent of the system of axioms in which the word occurs.

The axioms make existential claims and by taking them to be true we commit ourselves to the existence of the requisite objects.

Two sort of realist: 

platonist takes the objects to exist independently of us and our activities, and hence (since they are certainly not physical) to be in some sense abstract

constructivist takes the objects to exist only if they can be constructed, and hence to be in some sense mental. Numbers are constituted by our construction of them.



### Formalist

Rejection of the idea that the axioms  can be regarded as true statements about a subject matter external to them.

Axioms should be thought of as assumptions which we suppose in order to demonstrate the properties of those structures that exemplify them.

If any structure satisfies the axioms, then it satisfies the theorem.

Crudest version of formalism asserts that mathematics is no more than a game played with symbols. Frege's demolition of this view (grundgesetze der arithmetik, II, 86-137) is treated by most philosophers are definitive.
