**Begging the question**:
Argument's premise assumes the truth of the conclusion

**Commensurability**
a/b are commensurable if their ratio is a rational number

**Completeness**:
The ability to derive all true formulas from the axioms

**Decidability**:
Entscheidung

A general method to determine the provability of any given well-formed formula

**Algorithm**:
A set of precise (but basically mindless) instructions for solving a problem

**Computable Numbers**:
Those that can be written by a machine




**Quantifiers**

**Universal quantifier**

"for all x" 

$$ \forall x ""

**existential quantifier**

""there exists""

$$ \exists x$$


**Propositional Logic** 
Sentinal Logic

**First-order Logic**: 
Restricted calculus / Predicate Calculus

Quantifiers are applied only to variables denoting individuals from the domain

**Second-order logic**:
Extended calculus
Quantifiers can be applied to variables representing propositional functions

**Consistent** 
Most important
It is not possible to derive from the axioms of the system two contradictory formulas.

ex falso quodlibet
From false everything follows

**Independence**
No superfluous axioms. No axioms that can be derived from other axioms. 

**Syntax**: Is grammar it describes how to construct a correct sentence.

**Semantics**: Relates to the meaning
