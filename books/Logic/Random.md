**Begging the question**:
Argument's premise assumes the truth of the conclusion

**Commensurability**
a/b are commensurable if their ratio is a rational number

**Completeness**:
The ability to derive all true formulas from the axioms

**Decidability**:
Entscheidung

A general method to determine the provability of any given well-formed formula

**Algorithm**:
A set of precise (but basically mindless) instructions for solving a problem

**Computable Numbers**:
Those that can be written by a machine




**Quantifiers**

**Universal quantifier**

"for all x" 

$$ \forall x ""

**existential quantifier**

""there exists""

$$ \exists x$$


**Propositional Logic** 
Sentinal Logic

**First-order Logic**: 
Restricted calculus / Predicate Calculus

Quantifiers are applied only to variables denoting individuals from the domain

**Second-order logic**:
Extended calculus
Quantifiers can be applied to variables representing propositional functions

**Consistent** 
Most important
It is not possible to derive from the axioms of the system two contradictory formulas.

ex falso quodlibet
From false everything follows

**Independence**
No superfluous axioms. No axioms that can be derived from other axioms. 

**Syntax**: Is grammar it describes how to construct a correct sentence.

**Semantics**: Relates to the meaning





A type is a theorem and a program is a proof for that theorem.

 Dedekind and Cassirer on Mathematical Concept Formation
Audrey Yap 2014

It starts with taking what was long seen as a paradoxical property (to be equinumerous with a proper subset) to be a defining characteristic of infinite sets.

cf. Ferreirós 1999, ch. 4
(1999): Labyrinth of Thought: A History of Set Theory and its Role in Modern Mathematics, Boston: Birkhäuser; especially: Chapter 3, “Dedekind and the Set-theoretic Approach to Algebra”, pp. 81–116; Chapter 4, “


The definition is as follows: A set of objects is infinite—“Dedekind-infinite”, as we now say—if it can be mapped one-to-one onto a proper subset of itself.
