A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 

1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number.


Theorem.
There are infinitely many primes.

Proof.
Suppose that there exist only finitely many primes p1 < p2 < ... < pr. Let N = p1.p2.....pr.   The integer N-1, being a product of primes, has a prime divisor pi in common with N; so, pi divides N - (N-1) =1, which is absurd!



A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
