# Set Theory

> ...what mathematicians say is no more reliable as a guide to the interpretation of their work than what artist say about their work, or musicians. - Michael Potter 

**Set theory** is that branch of mathematics whose task is to investigate the fundamental notions “number”, “order”, and “function”, taking them in their pristine, simple form, and to develop thereby the logical foundations of all of arithmetic and analysis.


Naive Set Theory has contradictions because we don't define exactly what a set is.

    * ZU  or Scott–Potter set theory
    * set, collection, membership
    * subset, power set, empty set
    * intersection, union, complement

Frege identified two ways of describing sets, by extension and by intension.
* Extension means explicitly giving its elements
    * $\\{ 2,4,6,8 \\}$
* Intesion means giving a property which all its elements and only its elements possess.
    * $\\{ x \in N : 0 < x < 9 \land ~ \text{x is even} \\}$

A key feature of the mathematics of ZFC is that every object can be described in a finite way.

Frege's hope was to be able to define the natural numbers in terms of pure logic and sets and the set
themselves from pure logic.


Comprehension principle - The principle of creating sets from other sets.



What sets there are and how we allow new sets to be constructed from known ones is done in terms
of axioms, expressed in a the formal language of logic.

The axioms attempt to steer us clear of contradictions. We cannot actually prove that we are avoiding paradoxes, it's impossible
due to Godel's incompleteness theorem.


Writing down axioms for sets in a formal language is a way of dodging the issue what sets really are.




If something is not true for all objects, then it is false for a specific object

The order of quantifiers matters
