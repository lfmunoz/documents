Set theory is that branch of mathematics whose task is to investigate mathematically the fundamental notions “number”, “order”, and “function”, taking them in their pristine, simple form, and to develop thereby the logical foundations of all of arithmetic and analysis; thus it constitutes an indispensable component of the science of mathematics. (1908b: 261)


Intuitively speaking, a set is any collection of objects

These objects are referred
to as the elements of the set.



----
**Definition**: Intersection

$$A \cap B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$$

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to both A and B , and is denoted by $A \cap B$.

The product or intersection of two sets is the set consisting of all the elements that are common to both sets. It is designated as $A \cap B$.

The set consisting of the elements that A and B have in common.

----
**Definition**: Union

$$A \cup B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}$$

The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to A or B (or both), and is denoted by $A \cup B$.

The sum or union of two sets is a set consisting of all elements that are elements of A or of B or both. It is designated as $A \cup B$.

The set resulting from throwing all the elements of A and B together into one set


----
**Definition**: Difference

$$A \backslash B = A - B = \{x ~|~ x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \}.$$

The set you would get if you started with the set A and removed from it any elements that were also in B

----
**Definition**: Symmetric Difference

$$ A \Delta B = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A) = (A \cup B) \backslash (A \cap B) $$

The set of objects that are elements of either A or B but both


----
**Definition**: Subset

Subset A set A is called a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. We write $A \subseteq B$

We think of A as a smaller set that is made up of some of the elements of B.
Notice that by definition every set is a subset of itself.
If A is a subset of B, we also say that B is a superset of A.
If $x \in A$ then $x \in B$


----
**Definition**: Proper Subset 

A proper subset is a subset but not equal to the larger set. $A \subset B$ denotes that A is a proper subset of B.


----
**Definition**: Disjoint

Two sets are said to be disjoint if their intersection is empty $A \cap B = \emptyset$

A and B are said o be disjoint if they have no elements in common


----
**Definition**: Power Set

For any set A, the power set of A, denoated by $\mathcal{P(A)}$, is the set of all subsets of A and is written

$$ \mathcal{P}(A) = \{ x | x \subseteq A \} $$
