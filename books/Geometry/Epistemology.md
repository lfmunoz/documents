# Epistemology


> epistemology g. The study of the nature and origin of knowledge.


Right now something is happening, you are aware of something, how come?


The typical way philosophers have approached this using reductionism. They break knowledge into parts, in other words they classifying knowledge into categories, or types.


A priori knowledge is that which is independent from experience. 

A posteriori knowledge is that which is gained through the senses.




They wanted to make the case that a priori knowledge is more powerful. More, real, more truthful because the senses are not reliable.

Kurt GÃ¶del once said he is only interested in a priori knowledge.

What is truely a priori though?  There is believe that mathematics is true regardless of experience and mind, it has an indepedent exists and truth.

If you go down the rabbit hole of Euclid you will see that mathematics is grounded on axioms. Where did the axioms come from, I grant that once you have the axioms the theorems are a consequence of the axioms. There a consequence in a strange sense though because there is still the mind involved that can interprid the axioms. it follows in that because the mind users a certain logical methodalogy.

The axioms were arrived at by intuition. By a sort of educated guess. They were not written in a single instance either. There was a selection process. All this was guided by experience. 5h postulate is obvious when you consider your everyday experience.  


Mathematics in a priori in that it can be done without experience
 
 It really says something about the mind. That was is fundamental is that the mind can do a sort of computation.  A proof is a sort of algorithm.










empiricism - the theory that all knowledge is derived from sense-experience. 

a priori - from defintion, but what about a priori from pure reason. A priori from the goggles the brain wears. 

Only thing you can know a priori is that you exist and that you know.

The structure of Experience. You have an experience then you reverse engineer it and say how can this be the case.
can you imagine an object that isn't in a particular place?

When ever we have an experience the objects that we experience are located in a particular place.

That doesn't dependon experience, that is a priori knowledge.

space is a neccessary condtion of any possible experience


Numena Self has to exist, there is something putting everything together.
