# Geometry

* [Epistemology](Epistemology.html)
    * The study of the nature and origin of knowledge.
* [Euclidean Geometry](EuclideanGeometry.html)


Mathematically proven is often synonym for "absolutely certain". I used to believe that if absolute truth is to be found anywhere it must lie in mathematics. But to what extend is mathematics the truth? In Ancient Greece the Pythagoreans discovered that logic and intuition can disagree. It was intuitively evident that a common measure can be found for any pair of segments, yet they found a proof to the contrary.

Pytahgoreans were preplexed. They were sure, on intuitive grounds, that $\sqrt{2}$ being the quotient of two lengths, is a rational number. On the other hand they were equally sure, on the grounds of logic and computation, that $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.


Mathematicians decided to accept logic instead of intuition.
To say mathematicians consider intuition unreliable, however is not to say they have banished it from mathematics. The axioms are accepted without proof primarily because of intuitive appeal.

There must be some connection between Geometry and Physics. For example, in our common world environment it is obvious that the shortest distance between any two points in a straight line.
The problem is that is difficult to say exactly what a points or lines are. In Euclid's elements it says:

**Definition:** A **point** is that which has no part.

If each point contributes zero to a one-meter length segment, then
wouldn't the entire segment have length zero? No, it doesn't
follow, you are using intuition and not logic. The length
of a the segment may not be simply the sum of the lengths


The existence of irrational numbers to me means there is no smallest number. You can always compute a smaller number. Reality is infinite in the sense there is always a smaller distance or measure.
