# Geometry

* [Epistemology](Epistemology.html)
    * The study of the nature and origin of knowledge.
* [Euclidean Geometry](EuclideanGeometry.html)


In mathematics you can go in two directions: forwards towards the cutting edge, or backwards into the foundations. If you go forwards there is no end, if you go backwards you will hit a dead end real quick. I used to believe Mathematically proven is often synonym for "absolutely certain", but in Geometry you'll learn that bootstrapping a mathematical system is not precise and there is a conflict with intuition and logic.

The Pythagoreans in Ancient Greece were the first to discover that logic and intuition can disagree. It was intuitively evident that a common measure can be found for any pair of segments, yet they found a proof to the contrary.

Pytahgoreans were preplexed. They were sure, on intuitive grounds, that $\sqrt{2}$ being the quotient of two lengths, is a rational number. On the other hand they were equally sure, on the grounds of logic and computation, that $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.

Mathematicians decided to accept logic instead of intuition. However axioms are still accepted without proof primarily because of intuitive appeal.

One such intuition is that the shortest distance between any two points in a straight line. 

Another problem is that it is difficult to say exactly what points or lines are. In Euclid's elements it says:

**Definition:** A **point** is that which has no part.

This is the dead end because you cannot further define what a point is, there is some mathematical object called a point that we cannot say anything else about. Initution on the subject will also break down, i.e, if each point contributes zero to a one-meter length segment, then wouldn't the entire segment have length zero? No, that doesn't follow, you are using intuition and not logic. The length of a segment may not be simply the sum of the lengths.


**Note:** The existence of irrational numbers to me means there is no smallest number. You can always compute a smaller number. Reality is infinite in the sense there is always a smaller distance or measure.
