In mathematics often there is something that works.

It may not be understood why it works. Someone offers an explanation
but it isn't flawed, at least it is some explanation. 

I think when people disagree that dendekind cuts are valid
it doesn't matter because maybe there is some other formulation
which is more accurate or makes more sense, but that doesn't mean
what dendekind cuts are trying to do isn't valid.
