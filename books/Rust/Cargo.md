# Cargo

* [The Rust Programming Language](Introduction.html)



# Cargo

Cargo is similar to make

Installed **cargo** with a **curl** command to downloads into **~/.cargo/bin/rustc**

**rustup** is used for updating the compiler and looking at docs (**rustup docs**)

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup docs
cargo new  
cargo run #knows if needs to build
cargo build --release #builds a release which is faster
cargo build #without the release builds faster but executable is not optimized
cargo check #makes sure the program can build but doesn't generate executable used for dev
```





# CHAPTER 14:  More about Cargo

In Rust, release profiles are predefined and customizable profiles with different
configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over various
options for compiling code


Cargo has two main profiles: the dev profile Cargo uses when you run
cargo build and the release profile Cargo uses when you run cargo build
--release .

```
Cargo.toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```

Documentation comments use three slashes, /// , instead of two and
support Markdown notation for formatting the text.


For convenience, running cargo doc --open will build the HTML for your
current crateâ€™s documentation

Adding example code blocks to your documentation comments can help
demonstrate how to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus:
running cargo test will run the code examples in your documentation as
tests!

Another style of doc comment, //! , adds documentation to the item that
contains the comments rather than adding documentation to the items fol-
lowing the comments.  

```rust
pub use self::kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use self::kinds::SecondaryColor;
pub use self::utils::mix;

pub mod kinds {
// --snip--
}
pub mod utils {
// --snip--
}


use art::PrimaryColor;
use art::mix;
```


Before you can publish any crates, you need to create an account on https://crates.io/ and get an API token.


cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345

This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally

in ~/.cargo/credentials.

```
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has
chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
```


are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

A workspace is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock and output
directory.

```
[workspace]
members = [
"adder",
]

[dependencies]
add-one = { path = "../add-one" }

```
