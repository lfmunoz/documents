# Control Statements

* [The Go Programming Language](Introduction.html)


##  Conditional

<details>
<summary> cat src/if.go </summary>

<p markdown="block">
```go
{% include_relative src/if.go %}
````
</p></details> <br>


The reason ?: is absent from Go is that the language's designers had seen the operation used too often to create impenetrably complex expressions.


##  Looping

<details>
<summary> cat src/lopping.go </summary>

<p markdown="block">
```go
{% include_relative src/looping.go %}
````
</p></details> <br>
