Apache Commons Math: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/
jeigen - a wrapper for eigen - https://github.com/hughperkins/jeigen (includes complex and rarely found feature like matrix exponential and matrix logarithm)
jblas http://mikiobraun.github.io/jblas/ (also features more complex functions like matrix exponential, also very fast).
Colt http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/
JAMA http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/
UJMP - http://sourceforge.net/projects/ujmp/
EDIT maybe we can extend this list whenever one comes across and you know - the world keeps moving:

ojAlgo - http://ojalgo.org/ has promising benchmarks
Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML) - http://ejml.org
ParallelColt - https://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/parallelcolt
la4j - http://la4j.org/
MTJ - https://github.com/fommil/matrix-toolkits-java
nd4j - https://nd4j.org/ lets you choose underlying native implementations like cuda or openBlas
