A statically typed programming language. What that means is the compiler
always wants to know what the type is for every value in the program. When the
compiler knows the type information ahead of time, it can help to make sure that
the program is working with values in a safe way. This helps to reduce potential
memory corruption and bugs, and provides the compiler the opportunity to pro-
duce more performant code.

I.e, Go
