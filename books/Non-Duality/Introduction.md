## Is there different levels of awareness? I.e, Animals have more awareness than plants, and humans have more awareness than animals.

Awareness has everything, nothing has awareness. Awareness is the primary element, it isn't an attribute of something, everything else is an attribute of it.

Human beings doesn't have conciousness and they are not consicouness. Only conciousness is aware. 

An invidual mind is a concious field and thoughts and sensations appear in that mind. And everything that appears is made of that mind. A thought or a sensation is itself not concious. 

conscious is like the sun, it is always illuminating itself. It always knows itself. 
its knowledge of itself is mixied with its knowledge of other things (thoughts feelings perceptions) , therefore it's knowledge of itself is dimmed.

## Is there something to do?

Meaningless question. If you are a sepereate self by defition you are seeking. If you are not a seperate self, you are not seeking.

If you feel seperate be honest, be aware of when bubbling of loneliness, worthless, incompetely comes up and be honest witht he feeling. There somethig missing and you are seeking. If you are seeking seek for teh source. 

If you are not seeking. Then the question doesn't matter.

What is the best thing for me to do is the better question. Sometimes you got to go out into the world to become disilluioned enough. 




## How did you get to this?

All there is this. And in this stories thoughts and images arise. How can those stories ever piece together a story about this, we never arrived at this.



People have a story, but if you let go of the stories and realize that it there is something that going on that never changes.

It is always this.
