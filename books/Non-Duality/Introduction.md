## Is there different levels of awareness? I.e, Animals have more awareness than plants, and humans have more awareness than animals.

Awareness has everything, nothing has awareness. Awareness is the primary element, it isn't an attribute of something, everything else is an attribute of it.

Human beings doesn't have conciousness and they are not consicouness. Only conciousness is aware. 

An invidual mind is a concious field and thoughts and sensations appear in that mind. And everything that appears is made of that mind. A thought or a sensation is itself not concious. 

conscious is like the sun, it is always illuminating itself. It always knows itself. 
its knowledge of itself is mixied with its knowledge of other things (thoughts feelings perceptions) , therefore it's knowledge of itself is dimmed.

## Is there something to do?

Meaningless question. If you are a sepereate self by defition you are seeking. If you are not a seperate self, you are not seeking.

If you feel seperate be honest, be aware of when bubbling of loneliness, worthless, incompetely comes up and be honest witht he feeling. There somethig missing and you are seeking. If you are seeking seek for teh source. 

If you are not seeking. Then the question doesn't matter.

What is the best thing for me to do is the better question. Sometimes you got to go out into the world to become disilluioned enough. 




## How did you get to this?

All there is this. And in this stories thoughts and images arise. How can those stories ever piece together a story about this, we never arrived at this.



People have a story, but if you let go of the stories and realize that it there is something that going on that never changes.

It is always this.




# Why is there evil in the World?

Similiar questions.

Why the holocast?
Why do kids get raped?
Why is there starving children?
Why did this bad thing happen to be or to my friend?

Acient Christian Scipture took on this doctrine of the good.
That good is veiled and you get evil. Nature is good but
it can be clouded or covered, and that is what evil is.

There is a lot of explanitory power is such a doctrine, but
it Carl Jung pointed out the arguments is guilty of  the fallacy of 
assumption of the conclusion.


After you read all the books you'll come to the conclusion that evil doesn't exist.

Evil is an Illuion. Nothing bad ever happens.

That sounds extreme, but what is the evidence of something bad happening?

I believe we are God and God created our reality. Therefore if something bad happened
to you, the real you, God, then you wanted it to happen. That is the reality you created.
You wanted that to happen. So maybe you should ask why did I create this? 
And you won't know exactly. You can take guesses, but it is more productive
to just accept it and do good now.  

If you witness evil then you are in a position to bring good into the world.
You have power over knowledge of good and evil. what are you going to do
with that power? Obviously do good.

What if you don't know what is good or evil? Ofcourse you know, you are God.

When you start with the axiom god is everything, then everything follows.

In Logic we have this notion of 

Consistency - It is not possible to derive from the axioms of the system two contradictory formulas.

ex falso quodlibet, From false everything follows.

Without consistency the world collapses. incosistency is chaos, it is the unknowable.
you end up with everything else...

it reminds me of duality. There is consistency and there is everything else.

from false everythign follows, is unlimted

from a consistency system you are limited. Not limited in count though. It is different kind of limitation. Our mathematical system is consistent even with infinity, i.e, calculus is a mathematical system that works, and calculus is based infinity, limits, infidecimals. 

It is infinite in a different way. In a way that cannot be understood, that is beyond mathematics.
It cannot be limited,cannot be captured. Let us call it underline and give it the symbol _ .



# Why am I unhappy?

Similiar
I want to kill myself
why am I not Enlighted?
Why is the world unfair?
Why am I ugly, stupid, poor?

You don't know what you have.  Is a good first approximation.

It is not true that you are unhappy.
Because you wanted to be unhappy. 


Why can't I play the piano?  Because you didn't do X. 

Maybe a better question is, why can I play the piano?
You go to the piano and you play and you are unhappy. 
You think it sounds awful, you don't want to do,
you are confused, feeling unhappy.

If you go up to the piano play with it and , love the 
sheet music, love listening to exprts. Love experimenting.
Love working on drils. Happy around pianos. 

Why am I not Enlighte? 

Maybe a better qustions is, why am I not living the life I want to live?
Why am I not happy?    

A better question is why am I Enlightened?
You wake up with curiosity, with a realization that anything is possible.
With gratitude. Excitement and couroage. with love. passion. 
you are here to serve. 

What would life be like if you were here to serve?
Some may think hell and they would rather die. They rather not work, because
they just want to sleep.  Sleep is easy, sleep is fun.
Sleep can also give you nightmares.

If you serve you get to choose how to serve. Everyone serves, some people
just think they don't, those people end up dead. The oens that serve
go to "heaven".  










Why does  John Smiith lose himself in the play?

Beacuase he has overlooked who he is no.

No, he didn't overlook who is.

I don't like the world overlook. Or forgot.

what did he forget? who he really is?



that assumes I can answer the question who am I really?

I cannot answer that questions. Johm Smith should be able to answer that
questions. But John Smith cannot answer that questions.

overlook suguests there is something. some object that we need to remember.

Rupert, When you say King Lear overlooks who he is. I don't know stand that.
It seems to suggest there is some object that we need to remember about.
We overlooked something but we need to stop doing that and see this
other thing.

overlooked, ignored itlsef, frgot itself



He forgot who he is, once is realizes who he is, he will know who he is.
But then later we learn John Smith cannot know who he is.


if I think about King Lear, you put a thorn in my mind that says
I am not who I believe to me, but I am some thing.

Later I find out I am no thing.


You think you are miserable because of your daughters as King Lear, as Luis
you are miserable because you don't have infinite power, because you aren't superman.

But the real reason is because you forgot who you are?  Why do you want infinite power?
You don't really have daughters. You don't want to be superman, Luis want so to be superman,
who you really are doesn't.

The real you is happiness itself.

The real you is the source of all power.

YOu are the source of the desire.
the source of the object of desire

Who are you really? and what does the real you want?






Elightenment - Happy


conciousness - pervades everything. awerness is not in the background. the thoughts and
voice in your head is made of awareness. They are not you. The stuff you see
is made of awarenss.

Neti-Neti - I am not this, I am not that

Ego - I am this body and person







I would divide reality

the world , space time

sensation (body)
hearing,
seeing
self voice/thinking
