# Non-Duality

> We must not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.

This is a collection of information I wish someone had given me when I was younger. I was seeking something but didn't know what. What that is simply the fact that: **You are aware, you exists, something is happening.** 
 
This knowledge is nothing at all and everything. It is the most obvious, primary and simple experience and therefore it is easily "overlooked". It often takes an inquiry or exploration into the nature of that awareness, a path that leads to understanding that what you essentially are is infinite and eternal. With that understanding seeking ceases and you are left with peace and happiness.
