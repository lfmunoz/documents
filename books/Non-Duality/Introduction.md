# Non-Duality

> We must not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.

This is a collection of information I wish someone had given me when I was younger. I was seeking something but didn't know what. What that was is simply the fact that: **I am aware, I exists, something is happening.** 
 
This understanding is nothing at all and everything. It is the most obvious, simple and primary experience and therefore easily "overlooked". It often takes an inquiry or exploration into the nature of that awareness, a path that leads to understanding that what you essentially are is infinite and eternal. With that understanding seeking ceases and you are left with peace and happiness. 

Infinite is not something abstract (i.e, calculus) or difficult to understand where you may think, "that isn't my experience I have many limitations". Infinite simply means "not finite", there isn't an well defined edge, like when a child thinks anything is possible, or ask yourself how many dreams can I have?  

Eternal means your experience is outside of time, all thoughts appear in the now which is not an event.
