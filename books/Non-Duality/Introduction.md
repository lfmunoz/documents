# Non-Duality

> We must not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.

This is a collection of information I wish someone had given me when I was younger. I was seeking something but didn't know what. What
that was is simply the fact that: **You are aware, you exists, something is happening.** 
 
This knowledge is nothing at all because it is the most obvious, primary and simple experience and therefore it is easily "overlooked". It thus takes an inquiry or exploration into the nature of that awareness which leads to understanding that what you essential are is infinite and eternal. 

Infinite might sound exotic, for example if you studied calculus, and you may think that "that isn't my experience". It is much simpler than any of those concepts. "Not finite" as when you were a child and believed anything is possible. Also that there is no limit, or no border, doesn't your experience fade at the edges?
