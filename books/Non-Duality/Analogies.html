<p><a href="Introduction.html">Non-Duality</a></p>

<h1 id="dream-and-dreamer">Dream and Dreamer</h1>

<p>Imagine you are at home in Los Angeles and fall asleep you have a dream that you are walking in the streets of Paris. Perhaps that is what is happening now. God is having a dream that he is you at home reading these words.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>

<p>The objects in the dream are apparently in space and time and made out of matter, but when you walk there is no distance that was actually traveled. The objects are not what they appear to be.  You are not limited. You are not a collection of thoughts feelings and perceptions. Everything in the dream is made of the same stuff you are. There are not independently existing entities. The dream, you, everyone and everything are made of the same stuff and it isn’t matter.</p>

<p>No one has ever or could ever find matter, solid stuff that exists outside of mind or independent of mind.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>

<p>You won’t wake-up from the dream into a different reality. This analogy implies waking up is a big event but for many it isn’t. Also who wakes up? No one. There are no separately existing beings. The dreamer is not a person at all. The dreamer isn’t asleep or awake. The dreamer is not an entity.</p>

<h2 id="king-lear-and-john-smith">King Lear and John Smith</h2>

<p>Imagine you are John Smith a great actor playing King Lear in a Shakespeare play. You are miserable because you don’t get along with your daughters. The play ends, you go to the dressing room and you forget you are a great actor. Your friend comes in to congratulate you on an incredible performance and notices you looking unhappy. He asks what is the problems? You say that you are not getting along with your daughters but your friend tells you that you have no daughters that is just a character you play. He asks what are you really? You are not a thought or memory or feeling or sensation.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>

<p>You are not who you believe you are. You need to do a sort of self inquiry an inner investigation.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>

<p>King Lear didn’t forgot something or is mistaken.</p>

<p>Often the confusing is that when King Lear remembers who he is he will understand what is happening. He will gain something. But King Lear will never remember anything. There is no King Lear and there is no John Smith as you will be imagining. You cannot understand John Smith with the mind. There is a different way of understanding. Something is happening, isn’t that self evident or do you need a proof? How would you proof something is happening, how would you prove you exist? Isn’t existing self asserting?</p>

<p>When the friend says “remember who you are”. There isn’t anything to remember. There is no thing to remember. What you need to know can’t be known as a object by a subject.</p>

<h2 id="the-ocean-and-whirlpool">The Ocean and Whirlpool</h2>

<p>Imagine there is an ocean or river and it has currents or whirl pools.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>

<p>There is no separation between you and reality.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>

<p>If you are a whirlpool, then what are trees? other whirlpools? This seems to suggest that everything is conscious: rocks, plants and animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-flashlight-or-the-sun">The Flashlight or the Sun</h2>

<p>Imagine a flashlight it shines or everything and gives it light. The same way you know something and give it reality.
The flashlight cannot see itself.</p>

<p>The Sun lights the moon, it is self illuminating. The Sun cannot illuminate itself. It is the source of illumination and therefore the only thing it cannot illuminate.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you asked a flashlight in a completely dark room to turn itself on and to look around and see if there was any light — the flashlight as it looked around would of course see light everywhere and come to the conclusion
that the room was brilliantly lit when in fact it was mostly just the opposite. So with consciousness. We have an illusion that it is all mentality.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>Or is it an illusion? Can anything exist without the knowing of it?  I’m having difficulty with this because I have two opposing views:</p>

<p>A)  Everything that exists is known. Known is a common property of all manifestation.  Imagine there is an object (a thought, feeling, perception), you take away the knowing of it, what is left? I would say nothing because the knowing of it is primary and essential to any object.</p>

<p>B)  All objects depend on knowing for their existence but what if there is something more primary than knowing. Obviously we have no direct access to that, but we may be able to infer or deduce its nature.</p>

<h2 id="the-self-aware-screen">The Self-Aware Screen</h2>

<p>Suppose you are watching a movie, it is your favorite movie and you always lose yourself in the movie.
Your friend asks what you are watching and you say a beautiful landscape.  He then says, look at the screen.
What do you have to do to see the screen?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>

<p>There is something there, but it is not what it appears to me.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>

<p>Implies there is something you are missing, or that there is a confusing that will be resolved. An event where now you look at the screen and everything immediately changes forever.</p>

<h2 id="the-watchman-and-the-tower">The Watchman and the Tower</h2>

<p>There is awareness on a watch tower it looks out through different windows and sees different points of view.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>

<p>Everyone has the same awareness. We all see the same world because we share a reality.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Inaccurate</strong></p>
