# Frequently Asked Questions

[Non-Duality](Introduction.html)


## Is there something to do?

**Related questions:**
* What is the meaning of life?

If you are not seeking, the question doesn't come up, because there isn't someone to do or not do something. That doesn't mean nothing happens.

It would be better to understand who or what is asking that question because only a Separate-Self would ask that question. If you are a Separate-Self by definition you are seeking, the thing you should do or seek is the nature or source of the Self.

If you feel you are separate be honest, be aware of feelings of loneliness, worthless, incompleteness when they inevitably come up.  Be honest especially with those feelings of separation. There is something missing and you are seeking. What do reach for? What can complete you? Perhaps a feeling, relationship, substance, or experience. Sometimes you need to go out into the world to become disillusioned enough.  When you realize X won't make you happy, then you embark on a different journey perhaps in an inner direction.

What is the best thing for me? Could also be a better question.


## What happens when I die?


There are many incorrect assumptions implied by this question. You are assuming there is a beginning and an end, but you have never experienced a beginning or an end or time or space. It is always here and it is always now, yesterday is a thought that exists now. You are assuming that you are a collection of thoughts, feelings and perceptions these create space and time. You are not a thought, you are aware of thoughts. What is the evidence that you are a body?  

You need to do an investigation. Who is the I that is going to die? Perhaps you have some abstract vague notion, or a story of who you are. You have lost yourself in experience. You have mixed I with the objects of experience. The subject is not the object. What is the subject?



## Is there different levels of awareness? I.e, Animals have more awareness than plants, and humans have more awareness than animals.

**Related questions:**
* Is there a higher self?
* How do I increase my vibration?


Awareness has everything, nothing has awareness. Awareness is the primary element, it isn't an attribute of something, everything else is an attribute of it.

A human doesn't have consciousness and they are not consciousness. Only consciousness is aware. 


## How did you get to this?

**Related questions:**
* Why does the universe exist?
* Why is there something rather than nothing?

The why question cannot be answered. Any answer will beg another question. Imagine the answer is X, then you would need an explanation for X. It is a mystery, there could be a surrendering into the unknown or a seeing the situation for what it is. Understand.

Cause and effect is how the mind works, not how reality works.

Because of love, because it is self-asserting, because God was bored, because all possible worlds exist. All answers will ultimately be unsatisfying to the mind. Better to see the situation for what it is. Understand.

All there is this. And in this stories, thoughts, explanations and images arise. How can those stories ever piece together a story about this when we never arrived at this.

Let go of the stories and know that there is something going on that never changes. It is always this.

There is this and nothing else, but why this? There is one reality. If there were two realities then those two realities would be within one larger reality and that would be the one reality. 


## Why is there evil in the World?

**Related questions:**

* Why the holocaust?
* Why do kids get raped?
* Why is there starving children?
* Why did this bad thing happen to be or to my friend?

Ancient Christian Scripture took on this doctrine of the good.
That good is veiled and you get evil. Nature is good but
it can be clouded or covered, and that is what evil is.

There is a lot of explanatory power in such a doctrine, but
as Carl Jung pointed out this arguments is begging the question.
It assumes the thing you are trying to prove. I.e, you start
with the assumption that God is good, then you show there is no evil. 

Evil is an Illusion. Nothing bad ever happens. 

If that isn't your experience, If you witness evil then you are in a position to bring good into the world.
You have power over knowledge of good and evil. What are you going to do with that power? Obviously do good.



## Why am I unhappy?

**Related questions:**
* I want to kill myself
* Why am I not Enlightened?
* Why is the world unfair?
* Why am I ugly, stupid, poor?

You don't know what you have or who you really are.  

Why can't I play the piano?  Maybe a better question is, why can I play the piano?
You go to the piano and you play and you are unhappy. You think it sounds awful, you don't know what to do with a piano.
What if you go up to the piano play with it and love listening to experts play, love experimenting with sounds.
Maybe you start working on drills and you are happy around pianos.  Perhaps then a piano
gives meaning to your life, and perhaps the piano is irrelevant.

Why don't you just wake up with curiosity, a feeling that anything is possible,
gratitude, excitement, courage, love, and passion.


Imagine you are happy walking down a park trail, you receive a call and are informed that a loved one has died. All the sudden you become unhappy. How was the unhappiness created, where did it come from? Could the opposite happen? Does it take external sounds or images to create unhappy or happiness or can you simply self generate it?


## I am not a body but it isn't obvious

* Why do I feel separate?
