# Analogies

[Non-Duality](Introduction.html)


# Dream and Dreamer

Imagine you are at home in Los Angeles and fall asleep you have a dream that you are walking in streets of Paris. 


---
**Accurate**

The objects in the dream are apparently in space and time, but when you walk there is no distance that was actually traveled.

If the dreamer sees an object, he is only seeing himself.

What if the world as you experience it is a sort of dream inside of God's infinite mind and all the objects are made of the mind of God.


---
**Inaccurate**

You won't wake-up from the dream into a different reality. This analogy implies waking up is a big event but for many it isn't. 
Also who wakes up? No one. There are no separately existing beings. The dreamer is not a person at all. The dreamer isn't asleep or awake. The dreamer is not an entity.

There are habits of the mind which we mistake to be an entity. 


## King Lear and John Smith

Imagine you are a great actor playing King Lear in a Shakespeare play. You are miserable because you don't get along with your daughters. Then the play is over and you go to the dressing room and you forget that you are actually John Smith a great actor. Your friend comes in to congratulate you on an incredible performance and notices you are looking unhappy. He asks what is the problems? You say that you are not getting along with your daughters but your friend tells you that you have no  daughters that is just a character you play.


---
**Accurate**

You are not who you believe you are.

You need to do a sort of self inquiry an inner investigation.


---
**Inaccurate**

King Lear doesn't exist.

King Lear didn't forgot something. 

Often the confusing is that when King Lear remembers who he is he will understand what is happening. He will gain something. But King Lear will never remember anything. There is no King Lear, and you cannot understand John Smith with the mind.

When the friend says "remember who you are". There isn't anything to remember. 


## The Ocean and Whirlpool

Imagine there is an ocean or river and it has currents or whirl pools.

---
**Accurate**

There is no separation between you and reality.


---
**Inaccurate**

If you are a whirlpool, then what are trees? other whirlpools? 

This seems to suggest that everything is conscious: rocks, plants and animals.


## The Watchman and the Tower


## The Flashlight

---
**Inaccurate*

 Suppose you asked a flashlight in a
completely dark room to turn itself on and to look around and see if there was any light â€” the
flashlight as it looked around would of course see light everywhere and come to the conclusion
that the room was brilliantly lit when in fact it was mostly just the opposite. 
 So with consciousness. We have an illusion that it is all mentality



## The Self-Aware Screen

Suppose you are watching a movie, it is your favorite movie and you always lose yourself in the movie.
Your friend asks what you are watching and you say a beautiful landscape.  He then says, look at the screen.
What do you have to do to see the screen?


---
**Accurate**

There is something there, but it is not what it appears to me.

---
**Inaccurate**


Implies there is something you are missing, or that there is a confusing that will be resolved. An event where now you look at the screen and everything immediately changes forever.
