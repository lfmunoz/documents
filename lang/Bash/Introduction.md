# Bash

* GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell
* Bash is a case sensitive environment
* It is convention to give files that are Bash scripts an extension of **.sh**
* There are many areas in Bash scripts where formatting is important. Typically it involves spaces and either the presence or absence of a space can be the difference between the command working or not.
