#!/bin/bash

#  The hash exclamation mark ( #! ) character sequence 
#   is referred to as the **Shebang**

#  The shebang must be on the very first line of the file

# "!/usr/bin/env bash" would have the added benefit 
#   that it searches PATH for bash, and /usr/bin/env 
#   is more common than /bin/bash

# chmod +x skeleton.sh
# ./skeleton.sh
echo Hello World
