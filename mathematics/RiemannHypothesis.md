# Riemann Hypothesis


The real part of every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1 / 2 .


The Riemann zeta function is defined for complex s with real part greater than 1 by the absolutely convergent infinite series

$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots$$

No one has been able to prove that every non-trivial zero lies on the critical line.

A computer project checked over 10 trillion non-trivial zeros and it didn't find any.
