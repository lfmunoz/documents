# Topology


<div class="definition" markdown="block">
**Definitions** Topological Space

Let X be a non-empty set. A set O of subsets of X is said to be a topology on X if

(i) X and the empty set belong to O

$\emptyset \in O \land X \in O$

(ii) the union of any (finite or infinite) number of sets in O belongs to O, and 

(iii) the intersection of any two sets in O belongs to O

The pair (X, O) is called a **topological space**.

</div>


| $\|M\|$ | Number of topologies |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 29 |
| 4 | 355 |
| 5 | 6,942 |
| 6 | 209,527 |
| 7 | 9,535,241 |


<div class="definition" markdown="block">
**Definitions** Discrete Topology

Let X be any non-empty set and let O be the collection
of all subsets of X (the power set). Then O is called the **discrete topology** on the set X. The topological space (X, O) is called the **discrete space**.

</div>

The set X can be any non-empty set, so there is an infinite number of discrete spaces, one for each set X.



<div class="definition" markdown="block">
**Definitions** Indiscrete Topology

Let X be any non-empty set and $O = \\{X, \emptyset \\}$. Then O is called the indiscrete topology and (X, O) is said to be an indiscrete space.
</div>


<div class="definition" markdown="block">
**Definitions** Open Sets

Let (X, O) be any topological space. Then the members of O are said to be open sets.
