For years I've been listening to music wrong. You may think that there is no way to listen to music wrong, but there is if you are active listening or _dancing_. You want to piece together the structure of what the producer created and understand her intentions.  All music has structure and if you are listening correctly you can reverse engineer the production of the song and predict the sounds that will naturally follow.

What I would do is start bobbing to the bass and start the count randomly.  The problem is the count isn't random. A melody will start and end at specific places. You can't count until you know the pattern or the melody. Typically, the pattern fits an 8-count sequence, the difficulty is knowing where each 8-count sequence starts and not getting confused by an 8-count sequence that is twice as fast.

The producer created the song with a specific tempo and although counting twice as fast will still work, that is a different intent. It is important that you detect the starting point and tempo as the producer created it. When you learn how to correctly listen you can pick these patterns up almost instantly.

A simple example is the song [Computer Love by Zapp and Roger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-xnOMZyJes) Play it from the middle, you will hear a "ssh ssh ssh" sound. On which count does this sound land?  How obvious is it to you that this sound lands on the 3rd count?  What would be wrong about counting the "ssh ssh ssh" sound as 1?

The song makes more sense when that sound is on the 3rd count. The signing starts aligned and there will be a larger structure contained within the smaller 8-count structure.  To get this right you should beatbox or hum the pattern first. Then fit it to the bass or beat. That way you will be aligned and timed correctly. 
 

More Examples:
 
* Cardi B - WAP FT. Megan Thee Stallion  - Timing=8 / BASS=1 4 and 6 
* Tyla Yaweh - Stuntin' On You ft. DaBaby - Timing=6 / BASS= 1 2 3 / SNAP=6
