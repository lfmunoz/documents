Saturday night December 5, 2020: I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark. Good movie,
but I've seen it before and went to sleep feeling a bit disappointed. The feeling is difficult to express in words, but the gist is I’m being told that I needed to be doing something else on my days off. It's a paradox because the only thing to do is not an activity, it is simply be happy, any activity before that is irrelevant, but once that is taken care that doesn't mean we don't do something. There is a realignment of thoughts and feelings, “letting go” means not questioning those feelings, I'm being told that watching movies is something to do less often. I received a beautiful reaffirmation in a dream.

That night same night I had a vivid dream.  I was in a big mansion overlooking the ocean
on a mountain range. The house belonged to my family and they were away
on vacation. I went inside and went into one of the rooms. There were pets in there,
dogs and cats, I was horrified and upset that my parents could leave these poor animals locked in different rooms.

There was a pile of food so they weren't going to die but they had nothing to do in the room.
There was a fluffy dog on a couch just sleeping, lethargic, perhaps depressed. I opened the door and let various animals roam around the house. I became concerned that they might destroy parts of the house, but fuck the house, my dream Self thought, it’s cruel to leave those animals locked in the room. I went into different rooms and saw the same thing. There were animals in every room. Some immediately ran out others were depressed and didn't move much.

I woke up and one of first thoughts I had as the “waking self” was about buying books. I got up went on amazon and spent 200 dollars. Reflecting back I interpret it as following:

From reading books such as Aion I know that a house, city, castle, church, are common representation of wholeness, the true Self. The rooms are all parts of myself, I go into the rooms and see animals or small spirits or thoughts, ideas and creativity. I let them out and some ideas don't want to come out while some are eager to come out.  When I woke up my first thought is about buying books. I don't pick my thoughts they appear to me, so I correctly didn’t even question that thought. Especially early in the morning we are more suggestible and more in alignment with our “higher-Self”.

I’m thinking dreams are a way for different tendencies inside of us to coalesce and communicate, often not making sense due to contradictions and paradoxes, to opposite “spirits”. Anyway, here is is my Amazon order:
