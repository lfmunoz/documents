title: I wish I was worse at dancing

Oh wait I was worse. Last few months I've been posting my dance class videos every week on youtube [LFM - Dance Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x8TYugQpRQ). 

Every week I think... video is not that good, not going to post this week but at the same time why delete it? Google will store my videos for free, at 4K, I can just make it private. Once I upload, the more I watch it the more I fall in love with it, the more I feel it's worth sharing. I actually start thinking... I wish I was worse! I wish I had more videos from last year then I would have a complete story, a complete fossil record. I'm already in the top 80 percentile maybe higher, there are too many people who might watch it and feel they couldn't do it. If I had videos of when I started they could just go back to a point where their level matched my level and see this beautiful progression. That is powerful, something that has only recently been possible.

I predict some time soon we will see the full progression of the creation of a professional musician, dancer, programmer, etc. I'm talking about seeing someone that is a bad dancer and has videos of each week as they progressed to becoming good. It creates a truthfulness that is undeniable, it highlights the art itself, defines what it.

There are professional dancers who post old videos of themselves, but I've never seen a full progression. I've seen amateurs post a progression of daily clips for a year, maybe two and then they plateau, quit and stop progressing which is why they are not professional. I would want to see someone that put in the 10,000 hours, didn't quit and had a deep genuine passion for the art. I see videos of kids who are good, almost like they were born good, but also not exactly what a full progression is, they need to be bad first or else they become unconsciously competent instead of consciously competent. The first isn't as useful.

Another motivation for posting videos is that we are flooded with professional dancers with professional production. How many retries did it take for the video you are watching? One? Doubt it. There's something about that I don't like: A distortion of reality?  A misrepresentation of how high the bar is? The videos I enjoy the most are of dancers that are slightly better than me.

Anyway a partial record is always better than no record.
