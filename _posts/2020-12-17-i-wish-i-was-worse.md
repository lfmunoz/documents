title: I wish I was worse at dancing

Oh wait I was worse. Last few months I've been posting my dance class videos every week on youtube [LFM - Dance Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x8TYugQpRQ). 

Every week I think... video is not that good, I'm not going to post this week. At the same time why delete it? Google will store my videos for free, at 4K, I can just make it private. I upload it and the more I watch it the more I fall in love with it, the more I think it's worth sharing. I actually start thinking... I wish I was worse! Then I could have a complete story, a complete fossil record. There will be people who watch it and already feel it is too good, but if I had videos of when I started they could just go back to a point where their level matched my level and see this beautiful progression. That is powerful, something that has only recently been possible.

I predict some time soon we will see a full progression of the creation of a professional musician, dancer, programmer, etc. I'm talking about seeing someone that is a bad dancer and has videos of each week as they progressed to become good. It creates a truthfulness that is undeniable, it highlights the art itself, defines what it.

Yes I do see professional dancers post old videos of themselves, but I've never seen a full progression. I've seen amateurs post a progression of daily clips for a year, maybe two and then they plateau, quit and stop progressing which is why they are not professional. I would want to see someone that put in the 10,000 hours, didn't quit, had a deep genuine passion for the art. I see videos of kids who are already good, almost like they were born good, but also not exactly what a full progression is, they need to be bad first or else they become unconsciously competent instead of consciously competent. The first isn't as useful.

Another motivation for posting these videos is that we are flooded with professional dancers with professional production. How many retries did it take for the video you are watching? One? Doubt it. There is something about that I don't like: A distortion of reality?  A misrepresentation of how high the bar is?

Anyway a partial record is too better than no record.
