Platonist - mathematical objects have an existence independent of humnan thought, and thus the job of mathematicians is to discover the truths about these mathematical objects

Intuitionist - (L. E. J. Brouwer) Mathematics should be restricted to concrete operations performed on finite structures

Formalist - (Hilbert) Mathematics is nothing more than the manipulation of meaningless symbols according to certain rules and that the consistency of such a system was nothing more than saying that the rules prohibited certain combinations of the symbols from occuring.
