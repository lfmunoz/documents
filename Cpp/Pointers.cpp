Looking at the syntax of C++ reference declaration, experience C programmers may begin to think that
C++ references are a polished mechanism for avoiding pointers.


Once an alias has been attached for a target, the alias will be “permanently” attached to that target
and it cannot be used to alias a different target

A pointer is more flexible. Anytime in our code, a pointer can be alter to hold the address of a
different target

the & symbol can be used for three different purposes:
• As a bitwise AND
• As an alias declaration
• As an “address-of”, to obtain the memory address of a known data. Used for this purpose, the &
operator usually works in conjunction with the pointer (’*’) operator
