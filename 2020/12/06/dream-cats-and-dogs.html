    <h1 class="post-title">A dream of dogs and cats</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><strong>Saturday night December 5, 2020:</strong> I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark. Good movie,
but I’ve seen it before and went to sleep feeling a bit disappointed. The feeling is difficult to express in words, but the gist is I’m being told that I need to be doing something else on my days off. It’s a paradox because if we are happy does it matter we do? Especially on down time? Yes, it matters we should trust our feelings. I received a beautiful reaffirmation in a dream.</p>

<p>That same night I had a vivid dream.  I was in a big mansion overlooking the ocean
on a mountain range. The house belonged to my family and they were away on vacation. I went inside and went into one of the rooms. There were pets in there, dogs, cats, and I was horrified and upset that my parents could leave these poor animals locked in a room.</p>

<p>There was a pile of food so they weren’t going to die but they had nothing to do in the room.
There was a fluffy dog on a couch just sleeping, lethargic, perhaps depressed. I opened the door and let various animals roam around the house. I became concerned that they might destroy parts of the house, but fuck the house, my dream Self thought, it’s cruel to leave those animals locked in the room. I went into different rooms and saw the same thing. There were animals in every room. Some immediately ran out others were depressed and didn’t move much.</p>

<p>I woke up and one of first thoughts I had as the “waking self” was about buying books. I got up went on amazon and spent 200 dollars. Reflecting back I interpret it as following:</p>

<p>From reading books such as Aion I know that a house, city, castle, church, are common representation of wholeness, the true Self. The rooms are all parts of myself, I go into the rooms and see animals or small spirits or thoughts, ideas and creativity. I let them out and some ideas don’t want to come out while some are eager to come out.  When I woke up my first thought is about buying books. I don’t pick my thoughts they appear to me, so I correctly didn’t even question that thought. Especially early in the morning we are more suggestible and more in alignment with our “higher-Self”.</p>

<p>I’m thinking dreams are a way for different tendencies inside of us to coalesce and communicate, often not making sense due to contradictions and paradoxes, opposite “spirits”. Anyway, here is is my Amazon order:</p>
