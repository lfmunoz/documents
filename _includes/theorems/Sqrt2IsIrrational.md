**Theorem:** $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational


**Proof:** by contradiction


Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.

Let $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$  where p and q are whole numbers with no common factor.

Squaring both sides gives 

$2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$

$2 q^2 = p^2$

This means $p^2$ is even. Then $p$ must also be even because any even number squared it also even.

This has two consequences:
* p is twice some other whole number.
* q is odd, for which we said p and q have no common factor, and an even q would have a factor 2 in common with p
